ES6 Classes: Part I
    - class Person {
          constructor(name = 'Anonymous') {
              this.name = name;
          }
      }
        - You are telling the class that "This unique instance of this class's name = whatever was passed in (name in this case)

ES6 Classes: Part II
    - Inheritance, overriding parent methods, double-bangs -> See Example 1

Creating a React Component
    - Is ultimately just an ES6 class
    - See Example 2
        - When we want to convert an ES6 class to a React component, we extend React.Component
            - Globally, the two things from REact we can always extend is React itself, and then the ReactDOM
        - Every React Component MUST implement a special method called 'render()'
        - In our 'jsx' variable, we render our component by calling the class name in its own tag
            - Looks like a custom HTML tag
    - Class names MUST be uppercase
        - It's what helps React differentiate between a React component and an HTML element

                                            EXAMPLES
                                            --------

Example 1 - Inheritance, Overriding, Double-bangs
---------
class Person {

    constructor(name = 'Anonymous', age = 0) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    getGreeting() {
        return `Hi. I am ${this.name}!`;
    }
    getDescription() {
        return `${this.name} is ${this.age} year(s) old.`;
    }
}

class Student extends Person {

    constructor(name, age, major) {
        super(name, age);
        this.major = major;
    }
    hasMajor() {
        return !!this.major;
    }
    getDescription() {
        let description = super.getDescription();
        if(this.hasMajor()) {
            description += ` Their major is ${this.major}.`;
        }
        return description;
    }
}

const me = new Student('Michael Ababio', 26, 'CompSci');
console.log(me.getDescription());       // Displays 'Michael Ababio is 26 year(S) old. Their major is CompSci.'

const other = new Student();
console.log(other.getDescription());    // Displays 'Anonymous is 0 year(s) old.'


Example 2 - Our First React Component
---------
class Header extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <p>This is from Header</p>;
    }
}

const jsx = (
    <div>
        <h1>Title</h1>
        <Header />
    </div>
);

ReactDOM.render(jsx, document.getElementById('app'));
